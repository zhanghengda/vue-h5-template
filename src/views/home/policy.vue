      <p>
        All features on the PssGames Site are available without the need for registration by Users. No personal data
        (such as email addresses and phone numbers) are requested from users. PssGames may collect certain electronic

      </p>
      <p class="title2">2. Data collection and its purposes</p>

      <p>
        Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on
        the Internet). The PssGames Site may gather anonymous "traffic data" that does not personally identify you, but
        that data may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        When your computer or mobile device contacts our web servers (for example, when you visit the PssGames Site),
        our web servers automatically collect usage information. Such usage information includes information about how
        our visitors use and navigate the PssGames Site. It can include the number and frequency of visitors to each web
        page and the length of their stays, browser type, and referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior
        and subsequent to visiting our Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traffic information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous
        basis. More information about sharing information will follow in part 7.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, Advertisers on the PssGames General Site might receive information gathered by cookies for targeted
        advertising purposes. Further information regarding the use of cookies can be found below.
      </p>

      <p class="title2">3. Data Retention</p>

      <p>PssGames may retain users’ data for the following purposes:</p>
      <p>• To develop new features and improve the PssGames Site;</p>
      <p>• To support subsequent customer service inquiries;</p>
      <p>• To improve the safety and security of the PssGames Site; or</p>
      <p>• Comply with our legal obligations.</p>
      <p>
        We will retain your information for as long as is reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which
        this data was collected.
      </p>

      <p class="title2">4. Third party games</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of personal data by data controllers other than PssGames,
        such as providers of third party games available on the PssGames Site. The relevant provider of such a third
        party game is responsible for ensuring that any processing of personal data by them in the context of a game
        complies with applicable data protection laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, PssGames does not permit third party content providers to collect personal data about Users. However,
        if any personal data will be collected by a third party content provider, PssGames will contractually require
        that the processing of personal data by them in the context of a game complies with applicable data protection
        laws.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Security: We may release information about our Users, including IP address, when legally required to do so, at
        the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation or to verify or enforce compliance with the
        policies governing the PssGames Site and applicable laws. We may also disclose such user information whenever we

      <p class="title2">8. International Data Transfers</p>

      <p>
        PssGames may work with third parties that are based outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), and may
        transfer data about you to the countries in which these parties reside. Whenever we share personal data
        originating in the EU with an entity outside of the EEA, we will do so on the basis of the EU standard
        contractual clauses, with your consent, or because such transfer is necessary performance of a contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about our policy regarding international data transfers, please contact us at
        privacy@Frivgamess.com
      </p>

      <p class="title2">9. Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data</p>

      <p>
        If you are an individual in the European Union (EU), we collect and process data about you only where we have
        legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. This means we collect and process your data only when:
      </p>
      <p>
        • It is necessary for a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your individual privacy interests), such
        as preventing fraud, improving the Service, and increasing the security of the Service and network
        infrastructure;
      </p>
      <p>• You have consented to this collection and processing for a specific purpose;</p>
      <p>• It is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations; or</p>
      <p>• It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.</p>
      <p>
        Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object. More
        information on exercising this right can be found in section 11 addressing Individual Rights. Some examples of
        our legitimate interests and the data being processed include:
      </p>
      <p>• Network and information security (IP address, user/device ID)</p>
      <p>• Customer Support and fraud prevention (email address)</p>
      <p>• Improving our products and services (activity logs)</p>
      <p>
        Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent
        at any time. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact us using the information in section 12
        regarding the Contacts for Individual Rights Requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and
        use your personal data, please contact us at privacy@Frivgamess.com.
      </p>

      <p class="title2">10. Individual Rights</p>
      <p>
        PssGames makes certain choices available to you when it comes to your personal data. Please review the below
        information outlining your choices and how to exercise them. We will respond to all requests within a reasonable
        timeframe. If our full response will ever take more than a month due to complexity or scope, we will notify you
        of this and keep you updated. We may request more information to confirm your identity before acting on any
        request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Review and update your data: You have the right to access and update any personal data that we have collected.
        To review or update this data, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delete your data: You also hold the right to have your personal data deleted. This is sometimes known as the
        ‘right to be forgotten’. To request that we delete all personal data about you, please submit a request using
        the contact information at the end of this section.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you delete your personal data from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our
        active servers and may not immediately remove data from our backup systems for archiving, prevention of fraud
        and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a
        legitimate reason to do so. We may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations, such as if
        the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to exercise/defend a legal claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Restrict Processing: You have the right to restrict how we process your personal data in certain circumstances.
        This is an alternative to requesting the deletion of your data. Rather than requesting we delete all of your
        personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of your personal data to specific purposes. You may wish
        to request we restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your personal data and we are working to
        verify this information, or if you want us to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but cease
        processing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data Portability: You have the right to obtain copies of your information in a structured, commonly used format
        that you can move your data between our service and the services of others. We may request more information to
        confirm your identity before providing any personal data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right to Object: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing
        purposes or when our processing of your data is based on legitimate interests. You may request that we stop
        processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. This is an absolute right and we cannot refuse this
        request. Beyond direct marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why you
        object to our processing of your data, based on your particular situation. Even after receiving such a request,
        we may continue processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or if we can demonstrate
        a compelling legitimate ground for the processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a
        reasonable fee to honor the request. If we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for
        not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies. If we decide that a reasonable fee is
        necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.
      </p>
